##       Improving Computer Vision Accuracy using Convolutions and pooling layers
#In the project you could see how you would improve Fashion MNIST using Convolutions. 
# We could improve MNIST to 99.00% accuracy or more using only a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D.
# We must stop training once the accuracy goes above our desired limit. 
# It could happen in less than 20 epochs or more, so it's ok to hard code the number of epochs for training, 
# but our training must end once it hits the above metric. If it doesn't, then we'll need to redesign our Convolutions layers.
